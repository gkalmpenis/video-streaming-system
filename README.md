  A system consisted of 3 applications responsible for conversion, communication between them and video streaming.
</p>
<br>

## Technologies
* **Java 8**
* **JavaFX** framework
* **FFmpeg**
<br>

## Installation
1. Download and install **ffmpeg** (https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
2. Run the _.jar_ files of the applications (located in _Releases_).
3. That's it!
 
To log messages generated by the applications, run the _.jar_ files from a console (`java -jar <application-name>.jar`).

<br>

## Visuals
* **StreamDirector** application - converts a video to 3 formats (_avi_, _mp4_, _mkv_) and 4 bitrates (_0.2Mbps_, _0.5Mbps_, _1Mbps_, _3Mbps_) (a total of 12 outputs).

* **StreamingServer** application - accesses the videos to be streamed and implements the server logic.

</details>
<br>

* **StreamingClient** application - communicates with the server to request a subset of the available videos and to then request the streaming of a specific video.

## Features
* _New:_ Locate the path to _ffmpeg_'s directory on the user's computer automatically, without the user having to declare it in any system variable.
* Server-Client communication is performed using _sockets_ and _threads_. The server can accept and will respond to multiple different requests from a client. Supports **TCP** and **UDP** communication protocols.
* The system can extract information from the title of a video which is of type _videoName_-_bitrate_._format_ (eg The.Invisible.Guest-3.0Mbps.mp4).
* The client receices a list with videos that have a bitrate less or equal with his/her connection speed.
* Built with **MVC Architecture Pattern**.
