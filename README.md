# video-streaming-system
A system consisted of 3 applications responsible for conversion, communication between them and video streaming.

## Technologies
* **Java 8**
* **JavaFX** framework
* **FFmpeg**

## Installation
1. Download and install **ffmpeg** (https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
2. Run the _.jar_ files of the applications - Done!

To log messages generated by the applications, run the _.jar_ files from a console eg. `java -jar StreamDirector.jar`.

## Visuals
* StreamDirector application - converts the videos to the initial formats and bitrates.

</details>

## Features
* _New:_ Locate the path of _ffmpeg_ on the user's computer automatically, without the user having to declare it in any system variable.
* Server - Client communication is performed using _sockets_. The server can accept and will respond to multiple different requests from one client.
* The system can extract information from the title of a video which is of type _videoName_-_bitrate_._format_ (eg The.Rock-3.0Mbps.mp4).
* The client receices a list with videos that have a bitrate less or equal with his/her connection speed.
* Built with **MVC Architecture Pattern**.


## Notes
University project for the course of _Multimedia and Multimedia Communications_. It is built to work on windows machines.
